# Hypertrophy Workout Plan Synopsis

## Objective

This plan is focused on **maximizing hypertrophy** with an emphasis on:
- Developing the **shoulders** (especially lateral delts)
- Targeting **chest** with upper/mid refinement
- Ensuring **arms (biceps/triceps)** are not neglected
- Maintaining light but consistent **leg work** due to knee injury history

The approach is split across a **5–6 day weekly schedule**, leveraging:
- Volume-based progressive overload
- Movement quality and form refinement
- Giant sets and supersets when possible
- Frequent updates based on feel, recovery, and performance

---

## Structure

- Each week targets primary muscle groups per day (e.g., Chest, Shoulders, Pull, Legs)
- No weights are specified — tracked externally in the Strong app
- Each day includes exercises, target reps, and form cues
- Plan is version-controlled in a GitHub repo by time block (e.g., `2025_07_08`)

---

## Constraints and Considerations

- **Knees**: No deep squats, no high-impact jumps. Legs are hit once per week.
- **Shoulders**: Incline angles and fly movement selection tuned to avoid aggravating previous rotator cuff soreness
- **Form Focus**: All exercise cues and angle preferences are captured and continually refined
- **Recovery**: Volume is monitored closely to avoid overtraining smaller muscle groups (arms, rear delts)

---

## Tools and Logging

- Plan maintained in Markdown and PDF format in GitHub
- **Weights and progressions** are logged daily in the **Strong iOS app**
- Git repo serves as the historical record of the **base plan and its evolution**

---

## Status

- This version begins **July 2025** and is expected to run through **August 2025**
- Plan will be reviewed weekly and updated as optimizations are discovered
