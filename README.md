# Workout Plans

This repository contains versioned workout plans organized by the time period they were actively used or created for.

## Structure

Each folder represents a time-bounded cycle (usually 4-8 weeks) named by start date. For example:

- `2025_07_08/` → Plan started in **July 2025**, expected to carry through **August 2025**.

## Files

Each folder includes:
- `workout_plan.md`: Full workout split with exercises, sets, reps, and form cues
- `YYYY_MM_DD_synopsis.md`: Overview of the cycle's goals and constraints

## Current Program

**2025_07_08**: 6-day hypertrophy split
- Focus: Shoulder and upper chest development
- Schedule: Day 1-6 with one rest day
- Accommodations: Light leg volume due to knee considerations

## Notes

- Exercises include reps and key cues.
- Weights are intentionally excluded — tracked separately in the Strong app.
- Updates to form, angles, and cues are version-controlled here.
- Each cycle builds on lessons learned from previous programs.
