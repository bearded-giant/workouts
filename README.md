# Workout Plans

This repository contains versioned workout plans organized by the time period they were actively used or created for.

## Structure

Each folder represents a time-bounded cycle (usually 4-8 weeks) named by start date. For example:

- `2025_07_08/` → Plan started in **July 2025**, expected to carry through **August 2025**.

## Files

Each folder includes:
- `workout_plan.md`: Editable Markdown version
- `workout_plan.pdf`: Printable version of the full weekly plan (no weights)

## Notes

- Exercises include reps and key cues.
- Weights are intentionally excluded — tracked separately in the Strong app.
- Updates to form, angles, and cues are version-controlled here.
